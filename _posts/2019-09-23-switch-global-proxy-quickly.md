title: Switch Global Proxy Quickly
tags: network
---

Unlike the Google Chrome, Safari uses the system proxy by default and does not provide proxy API, so there is no extension like [SwitchyOmega](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega). Since I set my default browser to Safari, the tool to quickly switch proxy has become a necessary tool for me to access Google.

## For macOS

I use [SpechtLite](https://github.com/zhuhaow/SpechtLite).

> A rule-based proxy app for macOS.

### Install SpechtLite

Just download the zip file from [here](https://github.com/zhuhaow/SpechtLite/releases), then move the unzipped application into `Applications` folder.

### Configure Proxy Server

Before you start using it, you need to add a configure file (Filename can be set freely) into the profile folder (`.SpechtLite` folder within the root directory), which is `/Users/lynn/.SpechtLite` for my Mac.

You could configure your own proxy server according to the [demo configuration file](https://github.com/zhuhaow/SpechtLite#configuration-file). But if you follow my settings for [Shadowsocks local client]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-13-access-google %}#configure-local-client), you can configure it like this

```yaml
port: 9090
adapter:
  - id: heroku
    type: socks5
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 1090
rule:
  - type: all
    adapter: heroku
```

### Up and Running

Click `Reload config` after launching SpechtLite. Finally, start proxy by click the name of your configuration name, and check `Set as system proxy`. When you want to stop the global proxy, just click `Stop proxy server`.

## For Windows

It's hard to find a socks global proxy open source alternative for Windows that is as easy to use as [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com). But if one is not, we can use two instead ðŸ˜‚.

If you can [access google with Shadowsocks and Heroku]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-13-access-google %}#access-google-with-shadowsocks-and-heroku), you already have a Socks5 proxy. The open source tool [Shadowsocks for Windows](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows) has build-in global proxy options, then all we have to do is convert the Socks5 protocol to the Shadowsocks protocol.

### Tools

- [shadowsocks-heroku](https://github.com/onplus/shadowsocks-heroku/releases)
    - Connect to Shadowsocks server running in Heroku with [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), and provide Socks5 proxy in local.
- [glider](https://github.com/nadoo/glider/releases)
    - Provide Shadowsocks proxy in local, and forward requests to a Socks5 proxy.
- [Shadowsocks for Windows](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows/releases)
    - Connect to a local Shadowsocks proxy, and provide global proxy for Windows.

You should already have the first tool, so you only need to download the last two tools.

### Convert Socks5 to Shadowsocks

After you download [glider](https://github.com/nadoo/glider/releases), you can see a command line tool called `glider.exe`.

![Forward proxy tool glider]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Forward proxy tool glider.png)

To launch `glider`, you only need to run the following command in the `Command Prompt` after launching `shadowsocks-heroku local client`

```cmd
glider -listen ss://CHACHA20-IETF:PASSWORD@:8388 -forward socks5://127.0.0.1:1090 -verbose
```

### Configure Shadowsocks for Windows

The last thing before you start the global proxy is to add the Shadowsocks proxy server provided by `glider` to `Shadowsocks for Windows`. You need to right click on the icon after launching `Shadowsocks for Windows`, then click `Servers -> Edit Servers...`

### Set Global Proxy

It's time to enable global proxy for Windows, you just need to click `System Proxy -> Global` in `Shadowsocks for Windows` (If the global proxy does not work, check your firewall settings). If you want to disable the global proxy, just click `System Proxy -> Disable`.
