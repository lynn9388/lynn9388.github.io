The weather this morning was as cold as usual, but I was one of them at the entrance of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. This is the third mini-marathon I participated in. With my previous experience, I arrived at the starting point very early. The usual training gave me more confidence, and the final result did not disappoint me.

This is a new personal best, and I achieved a huge leap compared to the previous two competitions. Although I was a little tired when I was running, I knew that it was far from my limit. I hope that I can enter the top 20 next time.
